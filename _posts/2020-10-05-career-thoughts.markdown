description: free thoughts about my career path since we moved to Vancouver
---

Among the drivers for my settling down in Canada was the wish of a **professional breakthrough**, a way to slip out of the daily routine to which any job you hold for more than 3-4 years inevitably leads you. Besides, I had been feeling for years the urge to immerse myself again in an **North-American English speaking world**, not only to boost my language skills -which remains essential to me though- but also to embrace its way of life, its culture and its business environment and style. In other words, I definitely wanted to challenge myself, a sort of whim most of those reaching their mid-life probably have :) So far, even though only a little has happened as I thought, my desires have been quite well fulfilled. I'm stepping back now and going to reflect on the year I've spent here, mostly from a professional perspective.

I started looking for a job beginning of September 2019, right after my family and I landed in Vancouver. With a Telecommunications and IT technical background, mixing R&D as well as Engineering and Operations, I thought -inconsciously or naively- I would have luck and would find a job in no time - let's say 1 or 2 months, at maximum. Of course, I had heard here and there that the job market was quite different than that I knew in France, that the culture gap was significant. I heard also that you'd better grow your network for months before hoping getting hired in a skilled job, at least equivalent to that you left back in your country. **This period, that finally lasted 3 months, turned out to be the effective first part of my Canadian professional journey.**

First, I had to **review my resume thoroughly**, of course in its form and wording, but, much more importantly, in the sense that I had to **question myself** about my actual skills, my past major achievements, how and how much I concretely contributed to the business of the companies I worked for. From a distance, it looks very much like a meaningful approach that we've been applying for years in France. In reality, bringing accurate figures directly related to your own activities and their concrete impact, showing verified skills and track of record of your achievements weigh much more here, especially when you're coming up without any relevant local experience.

Then, the formality of finding a job turned into **a complete profesionnal fresh start** for me. Who am I? What do I bring? What can I offer? And by the way... if I could choose, what would I love to do? I finally made a decision that somehow tries to answer at best all those questions: I chose to put my heart and soul into studying and mastering some of the technologies that I had manipulated the concepts of a lot in the past few years, but that I often only scratched the surface. And if the real wealth finally resided in this **technical knowledge and savvy** for me and at the same time it got me closer to what IT and Telco companies are currently looking for?

Looking back now, I think I reached a fork in the road at that point. I started to develop the competencies of someone in between **IT Devops engineer, Cloud Architect and Linux system administrator**. By myself first, for a couple of months, then as part of my job in an IT department supporting the advent of Telecom virtual functions and 5G. Obviously, I wouldn't claim fulfilling today 100% the duties of even only one of those 3 titles, by far. But the mix of them plus my other background skills do make sense in an environment that is living a deep revolution with the step up of the Cloud and the evolution towards more automation and more agility. And probably the most important... I'm actually having a lot of fun :)

**To wrap it all up, I would say yes, it has been challenging turning the corner, which was part of my expectations. I would also say that I don't regret any efforts nor the self-questioning I've made over this period. And at last, immersed every day in an English speaking context, I would admit more than ever that it's going to take me a whole lot of time to master English... which was also part of the accepted challenges! :)**
