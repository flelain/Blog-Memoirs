This is a personal website, tailored to share **our family adventures in Canada**. The site creation and maintenance overtime is a family project, involving the five of us, especially in the content production!

Many thanks to <a href="https://www.wowthemes.net/donate/">Sal @wowthemes</a> and its minimalist <a href="https://github.com/wowthemesnet/jekyll-theme-memoirs">Memoirs Jekyll Theme</a> with which I quickly set up this website!
